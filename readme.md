# Company Finder

The best way to learn a technology is to get your hands dirty. Hence I started developing Company Finder. The purpose of this application is to retrieve information about limited companies which are based in United Kingdom. I have implemented this application using:

* [Angular2] (https://angular.io/)
* [ASP.NET Core] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/)
* [TypeScript] (https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Company House API] (https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/api/docs/index/gettingStarted.html)
